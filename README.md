# django-offline-docs-templates
For generating a better look django offline docs follow the official guide 

The original offline django DOCs which generated by Sphinx is somehow ugly.
I've made some change to part of the template/css files.

Just follow the official guide to generate the offline doc as shown in:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/internals/contributing/writing-documentation/

After you have generated the doc files in _build directory. Unzip the package and replace them in:
Location_your_django_source_code/django-master/docs/_build/html/_static
